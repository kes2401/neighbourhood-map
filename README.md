# Neightbourhood Map (React)

This is a single page application featuring a neighbourhood map with highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

The app was built with React to develop the UI and help manage the codebase. Map services are provided by Google Maps using the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.exp/) and all third-party data about each location is fectched from [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/).

This app was completed as part of the Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.
